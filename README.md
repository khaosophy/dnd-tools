# D&D Tools 

There are many great D&D tools out there on the web, but I was dissatisfied with many of the ones for browsing spells. That's where this will begin: a more robust system for looking up and filtering spells.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## APIs

There are several good open-source APIs for the D&D SRD. 

* [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
* [Open5e](https://open5e.com/)

We're going to start with the D&D 5e API. 

# TODO

1. Set up React Table to query spells
   * search
   * filter by class list
   * filter by school
   * filter by spell level
